# URetro
please come up with a better name than this

This is a WIP libretro frontend for Wii U. Currently can get basic graphics set up and loads a libretro core from the SD card (doesn't run it!)

## Cloning
Don't forget to `git clone --recursive` or you won't get our submodules!

## libretro
`/src/api/libretro.h` is the big one!
